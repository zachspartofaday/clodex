 * Releases 0.1.0-1.2.2 have no strict loader and silently strip slot state;
 * the credentials remain recoverable in the credential store. A registry
 * whose last slot is removed is written back at version 1, so older builds
 * interoperate again the moment no slot state exists.

 * A DISTINCT version, not a reuse of the slot version: a build from before the
 * stored selector existed accepts version 2, parses the slots, silently
 * ignores the unknown `activeAuthAccount`, and saves the registry back without
 * it. Version 3 stops that, because its strict loader throws on a version it
 * does not know. A registry whose selector is cleared falls back to 2 (or 1),
 * so older builds interoperate again as soon as no selector state exists.
 *
 * Versions 3 and 4 are also migration sources for downgrade-safe selection
 * storage. They still carry the provider default in `authRef`; current builds
 * project the selected slot into that field and park the default separately
 * before writing version 5.
