// tool-input-sanitize.ts — the single home of the tool-input filler-strip rule.
//
// Leaf module by design: it imports nothing from src/ so both consumers can
// use it regardless of their position in the import graph. Two call sites
// apply the same rule to the same data at different times:
//   - sdk-adapter.ts strips filler from tool input on the way DOWN to the
//     client (Claude Code forwards some tool inputs verbatim into server-side
//     API calls, e.g. WebSearch domain lists, where an empty list is a 400);
//   - oauth/responses-websocket.ts snapshots a chain head's function_call
//     arguments in that same downstream shape, so the client's echo can match
//     the head and the continuation survives (#84).
// If the rule ever forks between those two places, the echo diverges from the
// snapshot and #84 comes back silently under a different filler shape — which
// is why the rule lives here exactly once.

/**
 * Strip filler values GPT-family models emit for optional params instead of
 * omitting them: top-level `null` always, and empty arrays for properties the
 * tool's schema does not require. Required properties keep their empty arrays —
 * there an empty array is an intentional value (e.g. TodoWrite's `todos: []`
 * clears the list).
 *
 * The returned object is prototype-less so model-controlled keys like
 * `__proto__` are stored as ordinary own properties instead of silently
 * invoking the plain-object setter.
