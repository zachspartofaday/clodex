# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for coding agents and maintainers working in this repo. Read this file in full; load the
deeper documents below only when you touch the subsystem they cover.

**clodex** bridges Claude Code to non-Anthropic models — OpenAI API key (`openai`),
ChatGPT/Codex-plan OAuth (`openai-oauth`), or community-supported OpenCode Go (`opencode-go`).
Provider support tiers are documented in README. It is a trimmed fork of relay-ai (full commit
history preserved).

**Prime directive.** The translation, caching, auto-compaction, and OAuth-continuation code encodes
real production failures that are not visible in the diff. Prefer surgical changes over
restructuring.

`.agents` is a committed symlink to `.claude`, so harnesses that look for `.agents/` find the same
skills and docs.

## Toolchain and commands

```bash
corepack enable          # activates the pinned pnpm version
pnpm install
pnpm build               # compile TypeScript → dist/cli.js (tsup, ESM, shebang injected)
pnpm test                # vitest
pnpm typecheck           # tsc --noEmit
pnpm dev                 # watch mode

pnpm vitest run tests/patcher.test.ts    # a single test file

# Manual testing (after pnpm build; npm link once)
clodex claude --dry-run     # full wizard, preview instead of launch, no writes
clodex claude --trace       # debug logs to ~/.clodex/logs/
clodex models --list        # print clodex:<provider>:<model> names + aliases
clodex patch                # patch the Claude Code binary
clodex server               # foreground gateway
clodex providers            # provider registry management
clodex-claude [args...]     # second bin: launch claude bridged to a running clodex server
```

Before opening a PR run `pnpm typecheck && pnpm test && pnpm build` — the same three the `CI / test`
job runs on every pull request. Passing them is necessary and never sufficient; see the
pr-verification skill.

Development targets **Node 24** (`.nvmrc` pins v24.14.1; CI runs 24) while the published package
supports **Node >= 22** (`engines.node`) — don't use APIs newer than Node 22 in `src/`. Dev package
manager is **pnpm**, pinned via `packageManager: "pnpm@10.34.5"` and activated with corepack.
Dependencies are **exact-pinned** (no `^`/`~`). `pnpm-workspace.yaml` sets
`minimumReleaseAge: 14400` (minutes) — no **direct or transitive** dependency version younger than
10 days can be resolved; already-locked versions install fine, but fresh resolution of a too-new
version fails with `ERR_PNPM_NO_MATURE_MATCHING_VERSION`. End users install with
`npm install -g @bman654/clodex`; the dev package manager does not affect consumers.

Use `CLODEX_HOME=$(mktemp -d)` to exercise the CLI against throwaway config instead of your real
`~/.clodex`.

## Commit messages

Conventional Commits, enforced by commitlint (Husky `commit-msg` hook locally, and in CI on every
pull request).

| Prefix | Use for |
| --- | --- |
| `feat:` | adds a feature |
| `fix:` | fixes behavior |
| `docs:` | documentation only |
| `test:` | tests only |
| `refactor:` | no behavior change |
| `build:` / `ci:` / `chore:` | maintenance |

Add `!` after the type (`feat!:`) or a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer for an incompatible change.
Hard-wrap bodies and footers at **≤100 characters per line** — commitlint's `body-max-line-length`
is enforced by the hook and again on every push to `main`.

**Your summary line is the release note.** Changelog entries are generated from commit summary
headers. Release-please renders `type(scope): summary` as a bullet with the scope bolded and
issue/commit links appended, but the summary text itself is carried through unchanged. Get it
right — it is what every user reads. (The one hand-written entry, 0.1.0, predates this and is
preserved as prose.)

Ordinary commit-body wording reaches no user-facing surface, so nobody polices it. **The exception
is a merge commit**: `gh pr merge` without `--body ""` puts the PR title into the merge-commit body,
and release-please parses it as a second entry — a release has shipped with a duplicate changelog
line proving it. See `.claude/skills/pr-review/SKILL.md`.

Today most summaries fail. Reviewing the generated entries in `CHANGELOG.md` against the rules below
— 62 bullets, 60 distinct summaries once two duplicates are collapsed — **44 were judged unreadable
to a non-technical user** and only 2 clearly passed. That judgment is a review assessment, not a
measurement, but the direction is not in doubt.

**Write the summary line for someone who uses clodex and has never read the source.** It must say
what they can now do, what they stop seeing, or what got more reliable.

1. **Name the user-visible outcome**, not the mechanism. Replace `canonicalize`, `replay`, `strip`,
   `snapshot`, `serialize` with what the user notices.
2. **Say why it matters** — a concrete "so", "to prevent", "to avoid", or equivalent.
3. **No internal vocabulary without a plain-language gloss**: module names, symbols, protocol
   fields, `function_call`, `heads`, `nursery`, `canary`, `pty`, `stderr`, `previous_response_id`,
   `store:false`, `cache_control`.
4. **No implementation-only detail** — hash formats, dependency versions, test/CI fixes — unless
   tied to a visible install or runtime result.
5. **Self-contained.** The reader should not need the issue, the body, or the code.
6. **The 10-second test:** could a non-technical user explain the problem solved and decide whether
   they care, from this line alone?
7. Conventional-commit form, lowercase imperative, **whole line ≤ 100 characters**.

| Don't | Do |
| --- | --- |
| `fix(openai): snapshot function_call arguments in the sanitized downstream shape` | `fix(oauth): improve OpenAI cache hit rate by keeping tool arguments consistent` |
| `feat(openai): omitted-reasoning alignment and abandoned-head canary coverage` | `feat(oauth): keep long conversations working when reasoning details are omitted` |
| `fix(openai): suppress reasoning.summary for gpt-5.3-codex-spark` | `fix(reasoning): prevent blank responses on gpt-5.3-codex-spark` |
| `fix(proxy): isolate bridge settings from child commands` | `fix(proxy): prevent nested Claude commands from using a stale clodex connection` |
| `fix(patcher): include transform-set version in patch config hash` | `fix(models): detect patch updates so new model settings take effect` |

Prefer a scope a user recognizes (`auth`, `models`, `launch`, `images`, `openai`) over one that only
names an internal module (`adapter`, `transport`, `sdk`) where you have the choice.

## Architecture map

**Entry points:** `src/cli.ts` — arg parsing (`parseArgs`, `consumeBridgeModeFlag`), help texts, and
dispatch for `claude`, `server`, `models`/`favorites`, `providers`, `patch` — and
`src/claude-wrapper.ts` (the `clodex-claude` bin). Every other module is a focused unit with no
side effects at import time.

**Two bridge modes**, supported by both `clodex claude` and `clodex server`:

- **endpoint** — a local Anthropic-format gateway; the child gets `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`.
- **proxy** — selective MITM of `api.anthropic.com`; Claude Code keeps its normal Anthropic auth and
  only `clodex:{provider}:{model}` ids and saved aliases route to their configured providers. **This
  is the default.**

Details, including bridge-mode persistence rules, are in `.claude/docs/launch-and-wrapper.md`.

**The single translation path** is `src/sdk-adapter.ts` + `src/provider-factory.ts` (Anthropic
`/v1/messages` ↔ Vercel AI SDK, one turn per request — Claude Code owns the tool loop). There is no
hand-rolled per-provider translation; don't add one. See `.claude/docs/translation.md`.

### Cross-cutting invariants that are easy to break

These bite from outside the subsystem that owns them, so they live here rather than in a deep doc.

- **Auto-compaction depends on the response-model echo.** The proxy-mode MITM forwards request
  bodies **unrewritten** so responses echo the exact model id the client sent. Claude Code resolves
  context windows from the response `model` field but uses the request alias for preflight —
  substituting the canonical id in responses made patched/alias ids miss their window config,
  auto-compact never fired, and agents died with "Prompt is too long". Endpoint mode's synthetic
  `GET /v1/models` returns `context_window` per model so the status bar is accurate.
- **Anthropic-passthrough base URLs must NOT include `/v1`** — the Anthropic SDK appends
  `/v1/messages` itself.
- **The alias IS the model identity** once a binary is patched: the short name is what lands in the
  Agent-tool enum, is sent, is echoed, and keys the context-window map. Full rules in
  `.claude/docs/patcher.md`.
- **Do not restructure `src/oauth/responses-websocket.ts` or `src/sdk-adapter.ts`.** The
  continuation and translation logic took extensive real-world testing. Surgical changes only.
- **`~/.claude/settings.json` is never touched by clodex.** Launch config is env-var-only (plus
  `--model`), child process only.
- **`node-gyp-build` is a deliberate direct dependency that no clodex source imports.** Routine
  "remove the unused dependency" cleanup breaks fresh installs. Reason in
  `.claude/docs/patcher.md`.
- **Every SDK generation entry point must resolve `CLODEX_UPSTREAM_MAX_RETRIES` through
  `src/upstream-retry.ts`.** Adding a new streaming or non-streaming path without wiring it leaves
  that path on a different retry policy than the rest. Details in
  `.claude/docs/oauth-continuation.md`.

## Tests

`tests/` is almost all pure functions — adapter, provider factory, proxy, http-proxy routes,
registry, config, bridge-mode persistence, help text, and patcher (config building, hash stability,
manifest staleness, lock behavior, per-site transforms).

The exception is `tests/patcher-command.test.ts`, a genuine end-to-end exercise of `clodex patch`
and the only automated coverage of `runPatchCommand`: it drives the real command against fake claude
"binaries" (shell scripts answering `--version` and carrying a bundle payload after a sentinel) with
tweakcc's three API calls mocked, covering version resolution, backup selection, the
poisoned/corrupt-backup refusals, `--restore`, and the manifest without touching a real install.

Interactive launch flow and real-provider behavior are verified manually.

**`claude -p` end-to-end tests are manual only — NEVER add them to the automated suite.**

## Key constraints

- `--dry-run` skips all writes (including bridge-mode persistence).
- The `::ts::` separator in tool_use ids encodes reasoning signatures for round-tripping; would only
  break if a signature literally contained `::ts::`.
- In endpoint switch-menu mode the displayed context window reflects the **launch** model and does
  not update on live `/model` switch (Claude Code fetches `/v1/models` once at startup). Proxy mode
  + `clodex patch` reports correct per-model windows.
- Cost display in Claude Code is always inaccurate for routed third-party models (Claude Code applies
  its own pricing table).
- `MAX_FAVORITES = 100` is the persisted curation cap; `MAX_MODEL_CATALOG = 20` is the separate
  Claude-facing route, discovery, and patch cap. Every surface uses the first saved favorites in
  order and reports exact capacity omissions; an endpoint launch's separately exposed starting model
  consumes one catalog slot.
- OpenAI catalog ids may differ from upstream API ids — `upstreamModelId` carries the real API id.
- Never commit `dist/` (gitignored, rebuilt by CI), never hardcode a version string
  (`package.json` is the source of truth), and never run `npm publish` locally.
